			<p>Formed as a solo recording project in 2016, Messora has become a band that obscures and challenges genre. To the band, the music comes as what feels best in the moment. To the fans, it is a kaleidoscope of sound that appears different at every glance and to every eye. Messora has been described as Death Metal, Black Metal, Thrash Metal, Progressive Metal, Melodic Metal, and Doom Metal by fans and showgoers. The elements that make up the music may seem familiar to some, yet the whole remains a challenge to define.</p>

				<p>“Messora makes it work, creating a hella tight sound that incorporates it all into one potent wallop.”</p><cite>- Angry Metal Guy 3.5/5</cite>
			</blockquote>

			<br>
			<p>The band knows how to set themselves apart from others musically as well as aesthetically, with showmanship and presentation second only to musical performance during their live show. They demand attention with their presentation, but keep it with the strength of their performance and musicianship. Messora always delivers, visually, aesthetically and musically.</p>
